Celebrity couple Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma invested in Blue Tribe, a startup based on plant-based meat products, which aims to manufacture and distribute delicacies like frozen minced chicken, chicken nuggets, keema, sausages, and momos.

Though the look, feel, taste, and cooking style would be the same as the original animal-based meat variants but all of these will be based on plant products. Blue Tribe has been founded by Sandeep Singh and Nikki Arora Singh in 2017 as a meat alternative startup, which claims to use vegetables like peas, soybeans, lentils, grains, and more. All of these are proven to provide a mix of proteins, vitamins, and other nutrients necessary for healthy living.
Anushka and Virat claimed that they have been following the meat-free diet for many years now and now want to come up and “tell people how they can be more conscious and leave less impact on the planet by switching to a plant-based diet”, as mentioned in a statement by Anushka Sharma in a report dated February 8, 2022.</P>
